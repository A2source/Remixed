hi. remixed will go here when i start working on it. if you ever feel like cloning the source and compiling it, or playing a demo build if i upload one as a release or whatever feel free. this is just here for now because i'm browsing github for some reason and I feel like making it.

also BTW, all music and art assets made for this mod are free for public use. credit is not required but i appreciate it. so yea thanks for your time and enjoy sonic
