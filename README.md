hi. remixed will go here when i start working on it. if you ever feel like cloning the source and compiling it, or playing a demo build if i upload one as a release or whatever feel free. this is just here for now because i'm browsing github for some reason and I feel like making it.

also BTW, all music and art assets made for this mod are available for public use. credit is not required but we appreciate it. so yea thanks for your time and enjoy sonic
